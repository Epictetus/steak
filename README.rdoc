= Steak

Minimalist acceptance testing on top of RSpec

== What is Steak?

Steak is like Cucumber but in plain Ruby. This is how an acceptance spec looks like in Steak:

  feature "Main page" do
  
    background do
      create_user :login => "jdoe"
      login_as "jdoe"
    end
  
    scenario "should show existing quotes" do
      create_quote :text => "The language of friendship is not words, but meanings", 
                   :author => "Henry David Thoreau"

      visit "/"
    
      page.should have_css(".quote", :count => 1)
      within(:css, ".quote") do
        page.should have_css(".text", :text => "The language of friendship is not words, but meanings")
        page.should have_css(".author", :text => "Henry David Thoreau")
      end
    end
    
  end
  
No explicit givens, whens or thens. No steps, no english, just Ruby: RSpec, Steak and, in this example, some factories and Capybara. That's all.

If you are not in Rails but use RSpec, then Steak is just some aliases providing you with the language of acceptance testing (+feature+, +scenario+, +background+). If you are in Rails, you also have a couple of generators, a rake task and full Rails integration testing (meaning Webrat support, for instance)

== Getting started

<em><b>NOTE:</b> Please note that the stable version of Steak only works with Rails 2.x and RSpec 1.x. If you want to try with Rails 3 or RSpec 2, then you can install the prerelease version of Steak (using <tt>gem install steak --pre</tt>) which is based on the experimental <tt>rails3</tt> branch.</em>

=== Not in Rails

Just install and require the damned gem!

  $ gem install steak

Then in your spec or spec helper:

  require 'steak'
  
That's all. You don't really need to require RSpec.
  
=== In Rails

Assuming you have already setup rspec-rails, add this to your project's <tt>config/environments/test.rb</tt>:

  config.gem "steak"
  
Install the gem from the command line:
  
  $ RAILS_ENV=test rake gems:install
  
Run the generator:

  $ script/generate steak
  
That will create some basic helper files and directory structure under the +spec/acceptance+ directory, already configured for +Capybara+. If you want to use +Webrat+, just pass it to the generator:

  $ script/generate steak --webrat

Spend one minute on getting familiar with the structure and files you've got.

Now you may want to create your first acceptance spec:

  $ script/generate acceptance_spec this_is_my_first_feature
  
You run your acceptance specs just like your regular specs. Individually...

  $ spec spec/acceptance/this_is_my_first_feature_spec.rb
  
...or all together:

  $ spec spec/acceptance
  
...you can also do:

  $ rake spec:acceptance
